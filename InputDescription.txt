INPUT DESCRIPTION FOR THE IEC WIND GENERATING PROGRAM IECWind v5.10

  All inputs are required and will be sanity-checked.  For some wind conditions
some inputs are not needed, but they must be there and of acceptable value in any
case.

  The first two lines are title lines that can be used to describe the contents
of the file for your convenience.  These lines are ignored by the program.

  The third line defines whether the input and output are SI or English units.
TRUE defines SI, while FALSE defines English units.  The input and output
units must be the same.  IECWind does not do conversions.

  The fourth line defines the time in seconds for constant wind before the start
of the IEC condition.  This allows the turbine to stabilize before the start of
the transient condition.  This is not applicable to steady EWM or NWP conditions.

The fifth line is a comment line.  It is ignored by the program.

  The sixth line contains the wind turbine class, 1, 2, or 3, as specified in
the IEC standard.

  The seventh line identifies the wind turbulence category (should be either
A, B or C).

  The eighth line holds the angle of the inflow to the rotor.  The IEC standard
(section 6.3) specifies a maximum inclination of 8 degrees with respect to the
horizontal.  This angle is assumed invariant with height.  IECWind will print a
warning to the screen for angles exceeding 8 degrees absolute value, though it
will allow you to use them.

The ninth line is a comment line.  It is ignored by the program.

  The tenth and eleventh lines list the wind turbine hub-height and diameter,
respectively, used to determine the turbulence scale parameter and severity of gusts,
direction changes and shears.  IECWind checks that the hub-height is greater than
half the diameter, and that the diameter is greater than zero.

  The twelfth through fourteenth lines list the cut-in, rated, and cut-out wind
speeds for the turbine in that order.  IECWind checks that these progressively
increase as they should.

  The fifteenth line is a comment line.  It is ignored by the program.

  Below the fifteenth line, any number (up to 150) of wind conditions can be
listed - one per line - for IECWind to generate.  The allowable names are
defined in Table 1 below.  You will get as many wind files as conditions
you request here.  If you list none, you get none.
