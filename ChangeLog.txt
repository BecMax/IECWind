CHANGES.LOG for IECWind

09/10/97
Eliminated VAVE as it is only necessary in defining
the wind turbine class and not the wind conditions.
Allow use of lowercase argument for CATG.  Eliminate
unused dummy arguments.  Added titles and column
headings to wind files.  Reorganized input files to put
direction at the end.  Placed conditional read on direction
specifier to read only if program requires it.  Changed
direction specifier to be a + or -.  Changed units
specifier to a character variable to read SI or ENGLISH.

____________________________
09/11/97
Updated descriptions in sample input file.  Put in an inquire
for the existence of the input file.  Added POS and NEG to
the end of output file prefixes where appropriate.

____________________________
10/28/97 version 2.0

Eliminated the end time and set a default value of 600 seconds.

Added vertical wind component via an inclination angle.

Added ALL option to generate up to 25 wind files at once (including
positive and negative directions and shears, both 1 and 50 year
recurrence intervals, and both rated and cut-out wind speeds) for the
specified turbine class, turbulence category, and inclination angle.

Changed wind file naming convention to indicate the recurrence interval,
wind or shear direction, and wind speed (rated or cut-out).

Changed order of input file.  Made program more robust through use of
condition directed reads (i.e., if the parameter is not necessary for
the particular session, it is simply passed over, thus avoiding any
unwarranted errors on unused parameters).

Added statistics about each wind file at the beginning of the file.

Added the option "BOTH" to the sign indicator in the input file.

____________________________
03/23/98 version 3.0

Added linear vertical shear column to all cases for compatibility with
YawDyn v11.0.  Moved the column heading lines to a subroutine as these
are universal to all wind files.

____________________________
07/22/98 version 4.0

Updated definitions of some cases and added turbine dimensions to input
file as per changes made to IEC 61400-1 ed. 2.

____________________________
07/27/99 version 4.1

Added ability to use values greater than 8 degrees for wind inclination.

____________________________
08/05/99 version 4.11  M. Buhl

Added the compilation date to the version number in the output files.

19-Jun-2001 version 4.12  M. Buhl

I modified several routines so that the resulting files don't generate
warning messages in AeroDyn.  The routines were: EDC50(), EWM01(), and
EWM50().

_________________________________
22-Jul-2005 version 5.00  D. Laino

I modified the definitions of the wind events to reflect those of
Edition 3 of the 61400-1 standard.  Also updated code to Fortran90.
The input file has changed.  See InputDescription.txt.

31-Aug-2005 version 5.10  D. Laino

Brandon Gerber of GE Wind pointed out that the IEC standard specifies
"a wind speed range" and not the discrete +2 or -2 m/s coded in the
program.  To accomodate this, modifications were made to the naming
scheme of wind conditions in the input file, as well as the resulting
output file names.  I also allowed higher resolution on wind speeds
by adding a decimal.  See InputDescription.txt for the new naming
scheme.  I also added more robust error checking on the inputs.  I
changed the code so input file names that use wind speeds can be
specified in English units (ft/s) for those who still wish to use those.
I realize the listing of wind conditions could be more user friendly,
and I plan to make it so in a future version.

_________________________________
Unknown version for J. Jonkman's dissertation
Added the input option to specify either the -1 or -3 (offshore)
 standard for wind shear.

16-Mar-2010 version 5.01.01  M. Buhl

I deleted unused declared variables.
Yinping Yang pointed out that the header information for the EOG files did not
correctly reflect the resulting time series.  On the call to GustHead() in
GenEOG(), I changed the second argument from Vgust to 2*3.7*Vgust and the last
argument from T1+T to T1+0.5*T so that the peak of the gust was output instead
of the end.  I increased the precision on the values in the header to be the
same as it is for the time series.
I changed the version numbering scheme to the new standard.  This is equivalent
to v5.11.
The IEC standard (1 or 3) determines the shear exponent (Alpha) now, as it is
different for the two standards.

On 2012-09-11, Rebecca Sykes of Lloyd's Register Group Services Limited reported
that I had incorrectly changed a 0.2 in the calculation of ShrMax to Alpha, the
wind shear exponent.  Oops!  I put it back the way it was originally.
